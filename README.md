# Enhanced Selenide Framework
Unlike Selenide, this is an automation framework to be used by QA Automation Developers to script the test scenario then deliver it to the DevOps team in order to integrate the tests into the continuous delivery pipeline.

## How It Works
DevOps may choose different settings:
- Choose which web browser to host the test site
- Choose which tests to run
- Choose how to handle the test outcome
- Choose between serial or parallel test run

All of the above with just a single java package.
