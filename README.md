# Enhanced Selenide Framework
Unlike Selenide, this is an automation framework to be used by QA Automation Developers to script the test scenario then passing on to the DevOps team in order to integrate the tests into the continious delivery pipeline.

## How It Works
The tests are scripted once but they can run on different environments:
- Choose what web browser will host the test site
- Choose which tests should be run
All of the above with just a single java package.
